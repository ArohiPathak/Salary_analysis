# üìà Analyzing and Predicting Salaries Across Job Roles
Understanding public employee compensation is vital for ensuring transparency, accountability, and effective budgeting in government operations. The dataset contains more than 300k employee records found in San Francisco from 2011 to 2018. This project explores a salary dataset containing information about job titles, experience levels, company sizes, employment types, and work locations. The goal is to analyze how different factors affect salaries across industries and regions.
